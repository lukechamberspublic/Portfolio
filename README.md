# Long Term Model

This project creates predictions for every match for the rest of the season for any of the top 5 European Leagues, based on optimised goal, xG and betting line ratings. 
These predictions are then used to create a league table with predicted number of points, goals scored and goals conceded at the end of the season.
It also contains predictions for each teams likelihhod to finish 1st, Top 4, Top 6 and Bottom 3, derived from running Monte Carlo simulations on the rest of the seasons fixtures.

## Setup

If you do not already have all dependant packages installed you can install the them by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

From there you can navigate to the project folder and open LT_model.ipynb.

## Data

The following data files are used in this project:
- `data/'League'.csv`: Five individual files containing historical betting odds for top 5 leagues.
- `data/goallines.csv`: Contains a lookup table to convert betting lines into goal expectancies for each match.
- `data/supconversion.csv`: Contains a lookup table to convert betting lines into goal expectancies for each match.

These files are located in the `data/` folder.

In addition to these files the script scrapes historical and future fixture information using the Understat API
